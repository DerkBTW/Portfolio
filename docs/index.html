        <p>Hello everyone out on the fantastic world wide web! I'm Derek Kirsch, a developer at PSU working under the gracious guidance of Dr. B, who has been too kind in showing me the ways of online code. In all, this website shows my detailed understanding of everything going on in DIGIT 100 as I begin my journey in the Digital Humanities field.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. They are a major reason I've been able to code as much as I have been, so they deserve a shout-out!</p>
        <h2>My Website</h2>
        <p>The website I've created, while basic in functionality, is able to show you many things about myself, experiences I've had that make me suitable for a job, and anything else I may want the people of the world to know about me. The first prime example of this is my resume, which sits front and center on my homepage. I don't know if I'll actually be pointing anyone in the direction of this website when I decide to find a job, so my website's a bit simple currently. But who knows what the future holds!</p>
     <h2>My Resume</h2>
        <p>Over the years, I've compiled a great deal of my work experiences along with where I'd like to go with them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sales Associate:</b>I worked as a sales associate for a second-hand clothing store for several months, only leaving in order to attend college. At this store, I gained quality experience with working in retail, customer service, and sales. Teamwork and understanding were other essentials of this job, and harnessing those skills allowed me to maintain both my job and a good working environment for my co-workers and customers.</li>
            <li><b>Theater Group Personage:</b>I was highly involved in my school's sophisticated theater program for about 7 years leading up to my graduation. Learning when I was young and growing into a leadership position in an organization which is now so close to my heart allowed me to gain experience with leadership skills, responsibility, and working hand-in-hand with professionals like teachers and staff, as well as teens and children who were equal to or below my age.</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <p>Here is a silly sentence Derek is writing just to see it appear on the website.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
