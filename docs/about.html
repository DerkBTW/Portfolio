        <p>Hello everyone out there! I'm Derek Kirsch, the person struggling to make this website (I'll figure it out, don't worry). Anywho, if you clicked on this "All About Me" page, you probably want to learn about me!<p>
            <p>I started out my life as a city-kid born in the country, first sprouting my wings in aspects of theatrical arts. Jack of all trades but master of none, I soon found myself on sports teams, in FBLA, as well as marching band, and many other extracurricular activities, searching for something that piqued my interest. My favorite snapshots of my life include playing the Mad Hatter in my highschool's talented production of Alice in Wonderland (though I'll never be able to live up to Johnny Depp's capabilities), being a professional gamer for far too long of a time to admit, and *trying* to be kind and make friends with most people.<p>
 <p>I enjoy a lot of stuff:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sports! Actually playing sports isn't my strongest suit, but I find watching them to be very interesting. I'm a big fan of the Eagles in the NFL, and the Phillies in baseball, and am a big fan of March Madness for college basketball. (I was a bigger fan before Zion Williamson got drafted to the Pelicans and disappeared forever, but that's besides the point.) I'd like to think I can hold my own for most games of pickup in sports, but I'm nowhere near good.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And I somehow ended up at Behrend! Time really flies, and I'm still not sure what I'm doing, but a least I'm enjoying being along for the ride (mostly).<p>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
            website</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <p>Here is a silly sentence Derek is writing just to see it appear on the website.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
