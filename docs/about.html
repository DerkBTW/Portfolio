        <p>Hello everyone out there! I'm Derek Kirsch, the person struggling to make this website (I'll figure it out, don't worry). Anywho, if you clicked on this "All About Me" page, you probably want to learn about me!<p>
            <p>I started out my life as a city-kid born in the country, first sprouting my wings in aspects of theatrical arts. Jack of all trades but master of none, I soon found myself on sports teams, in FBLA, as well as marching band, and many other extracurricular activities, searching for something that piqued my interest. My favorite snapshots of my life include playing the Mad Hatter in my highschool's talented production of Alice in Wonderland (though I'll never be able to live up to Johnny Depp's capabilities), being a professional gamer for far too long of a time to admit, and *trying* to be kind and make friends with lots of people.<p>
 <p>I enjoy a lot of stuff:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sports! Actually playing sports isn't my strongest suit, but I find watching them to be very interesting. I'm a big fan of the Eagles in the NFL, and the Phillies in baseball, and am a big fan of March Madness for college basketball. (I was a bigger fan before Zion Williamson got drafted to the Pelicans and disappeared forever, but that's besides the point.) I'd like to think I can hold my own for most games of pickup in sports, but I'm nowhere near good.</li>
     <li>Music! I listen to all types of music, from jazz to punk and metal to rap. However, I do find country music super boring. Every country song sounds the same and no one can change my mind.</li>
     <li>Theater Arts! I was in Theater Club throughout my entire highschool career, and found myself in roles like Willy Wonka, the Mad Hatter, and several others. I enjoy the creative spirit performing gives me, but I don't feel the same about attracting attention in a public setting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And enjoying my way through life is how I somehow ended up at Behrend! Time really flies, and I'm still not sure what I'm doing, but a least I'm enjoying being along for the ride (mostly). Making this website is just a stepping stone towards what I'm doing later in life! Hope you enjoy my site!<p>
