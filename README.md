This is my workspace on Github because it is required! I will be mostly working on Wordpress because Github is a huge pain!
For my Text Comparison and Analysis, I chose to compare and analyze the lyrics Paramore, my favorite band. I compiled the lyrics from all six of their official albums and formulated them into Ngram analysis.
I'm going to be posting all of my findings into Wordpress and working on that because it is much easier.
